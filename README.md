VIMrc
=====

Personal VIM configuration, if you != me then it might not work for you. Although I tried to make
this configuration as modular as possible, there might be multiple binary dependencies (nc, ctags, java, etc.),
as well as platform dependencies (I work on GNU/Linux systems).

## Current features

Java development features:
  * Automatic compile on save using [VIM-Java-Build](https://github.com/robertbraeutigam/vim-java-build)
  * Automatic tags management using [VIM-Java-Tags](https://github.com/robertbraeutigam/vim-java-tags)

Other features:
   * Modular using [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
   * Git enabled using [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
   * Nice using [Airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline)
   * Feedback using [Quickfixsigns](https://github.com/tomtom/quickfixsigns_vim)
